###### About: 
This command line program, built in Python, calls the Spotify API and retrieves data based off of the search term that the user passes to the api.  Based off of the search term (for an artist), the program returns ten most recent albums, top ten songs by the artist and a link to the artist's profile page on spotify.com.
